Unit 1: Linked Lists	
In this unit you are going to learn all about Linked Lists, get basic understanding of their API and insight into their internals.	
	
Task	Explanation: Basics of Lists
Description	Explain the basic data structure of a list in general and describes its characteristics.
Assignment	A "List" is a data type, which is equally available in most programming languages. Though the internal implementation might differ, it always provides means for inserting and accessing elements in an ordered fashion. Thus, each added element might be accessed by its index position within the list.
Achievements	List (API), Common Datatype
	
Task	Multiple Choice: Duplicated Elements
Description	Can an element be added twice?
Assignment	Can the same object, e.g. the number "6", added twice into the list preserving independent indexes?
Choices	yes => yes, no => no, dependes => it depends
Solution	yes
Achievements	List (API), Common Datatype
	
Task	Explanation: Implementation Strategy
Description	Analyses implementation strategies for lists.
Assignment	Indexed collections, such as lists, are implemented by facilitating one of two main strategies: array- or node-based.
	
	In the array-based approach an continues block of memory is allocated and the fixed-size list elements added continuesly. Indexed elements are accessed by calculating their memory position by multiplying their index with the lists element's size. 
	
	On the other hand, a list might be constructed using nodes linking each other in insert-order. Access is then performed by traversing the node's graph until the node with the requested index is found.
Achievements	List (API), Linked List, Array List
	
Task	Multiple Choice: Access Performance
Description	Points out the performance of the two list types.
Assignment	After inserting seven elements in order you try to access the fifths. Which implementation provides faster access?
Choices	linked => Linked List, arrayed => Arrayed List, both => access is equally fast
Solution	arrayed
Achievements	Linked List, Array List
	
Task	Multiple Choice: Capacity of Linked Lists
Description	Questions and explains the capacity of linked lists.
Assignment	In the following we facilitate linked lists if not stated different. In a linked list elements are stored within nodes, which are linked to each other. Does this imply an implementation-inherent capacity limitation?
Choices	yes => yes, no => no
Solution	no
Achievements	Linked List
	
Task	Explanation: Visualize Insertion
Description	Distinguish the basic data structure of a linked list into double and single linked list.
Assignment	The group of "Linked Lists" is distinguished into two kinds: the single linked list vs. double linked list.
	
	In a single linked list for each node a reference to the successing node is stored among with a reference to the root (= first) node.
	
	A double linked list additionally stores the backwards path; each node keeps track of its predecessing node and a reference to the last node is hold.
Achievements	Linked List
	
Task	Explanation: Visualize Insertion
Description	Explain the basic data structure of a single linked list and visualize the insertion of three list elements.
Assignment	A single linked list, which we simply refer to as linked list during the following tasks, initially keeps no reference as no root node is existing.
	After insertion of a first element [operation: add(E)] a new node referencing the inserted element is created and set as root. It does not contain any reference to a successing node yet.
	
	With the addition of more elements (standard implementation: at the end) the node list is traversed beginning from root until a node without successor is found. A new node is created at this position and a reference to it is stored within the previously last node.
